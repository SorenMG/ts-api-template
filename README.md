# REST API example using Typescript
This example makes making an API fast with its already built user registration, authentication and user lookup. It uses the 3 layer architecture with a controller layer, service layer and a data access layer. It is heavily inspired by **santiq's** repository [Bulletproof nodejs](https://github.com/santiq/bulletproof-nodejs)
